# Task: 02 Tuple Manipulation:

# Tuple representing the stats of a video game character:
character_stats = (100, 50, 30)  # (health, attack, defense)
print("Original Character Stats:", character_stats)

# Create a new tuple with upgraded stats
# Increase attack by 10 and defense by 5
upgraded_stats = (character_stats[0], character_stats[1] + 10, character_stats[2] + 5)

# Print both the original and upgraded stats
print("Upgraded Character Stats:", upgraded_stats)
